So, we have used bug for condition editors, so we are first accepting the action and it's like reach and then we go up, down and like we have action items, so we are. first classifying them and then after we are using part for and we have we we have three sports part is the health diversity score for the evaluation and the second classifying them. The last one is a diaphragm, it's a... Our model is not missing, can I? We are easily readable and So we like completed the basic UI for the product. So initially we are going to go with the, like, recording it will start recording my voice and converting into transcripts. So, like, so initially what I did. There is no, like, no models. couple. directly to the model. and then promoting. I stream up. giving us the work that is part of it. So what I decided to do is record one second of audio and pass it to model and transcribe. But in that model, They want an issue like When I pass, one second, I'll call you. Uh, let. when the audio cuts at one second and it is between a word or a typical movement. So it will not catch up, it will go away in the next or like chunk of one second. It's been jagged it out. There is no warning. So, I try to look on internet, I try to find one, what it does is I try to... when I am speaking and when I am stopped. So, by the way, I stopped talking, it changed my outlook in the summer. You know, like. Another uh... Basically, white space and the orbital heat. able to satirize and whenever I stop talking, it changes always. So what? and get the transcripts out and recording by next year. So that. My, uh, any... like no words will be lost. while transferring from. So, try to solve. So this is the whole article. Thank you very much. and I'll be sending you away. And. The plan for speech make is we are going to add a I'd like this to be made for you, I'd like to... and I don't like it. Stop recording for television them. So, clear that one for them. Basically, it triggers the backend summarization models. back in the mid-year and... send that an email or either show it on. Thank you. Go for it. So, thanks. Any questions? Yes, I will. It will really be seen a bit of multi-capsule. Go next. Thank you. So, that's all. It's a mic. Thank you. Oh my god I'm tripping. No, it's okay, it's okay. I'll be to my home in a few seconds. Uh, right now we have Yeah, right now we are using system swag. I need to check. Like how does that work like taking the desktop audio and all So I was trying like by playing multiple... YouTube podcast So it was like taking the audio, it's coming out from the sound and. from the... like taking back in the fight, so I need to figure it, figure that out like. uh... It's actually similar to me. like Google needs meeting and try to. Any other questions? you Oh like acceptance. Right now, I don't really have a creative plan. Bye. All right. Bye. fly. I am not sure what to do. of small teams. Thank you. on it. Please do not delay. people See you. from that I don't know. It's okay. We'll see you next week. You're welcome. Awesome, thank you. So, for these, like... we have done like. point analysis basics and. I have tried to... Uh... thing like measures the latency like the Uh word when I spoke in the class. So it's around three seconds. So, I am like trying to reduce it, I try to reduce. Thank you. before it was like if I speed going down sentence continuously without taking a gap. My servo was used to break, but it was extra large. Lots of lots of data help one channel. So I reduce, I like fine-du me. Like you can see the empty frame rate, it is out. like value for an empty framework. So I-55. take a small gap.
